# LoanRateCalculatorService ðŸ’¶
## Description
This project aims to create and implement a website that allows you to calculate loan installments based on the given parameters, while checking whether the interest rate is higher than the reference interest rate. If so, the process will be terminated and the appropriate response will be returned. Otherwise, the project will recalculate the installment value and the remaining loan amount, saving the results as a new object in the database.
